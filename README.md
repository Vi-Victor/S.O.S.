# S.O.S.

_S.O.S._ is a (WIP) game.

It stands for "Sounds Of Space", and is meant to convey feelings of loneliness, isolation, and a desire to explore. Currently, it consists of a space-like environment with a few UI elements tied to a somewhat randomly arranged set of 4 synthesizers, each with their own sequence.

Since this was my first time working with 3D and audio in this type of programming environment, I greatly underestimated how much time the project would take. This is why it's much farther from being finished (by the end of the semester) than I originally intended it to be. I did make everything in a modular way, however, so the majority of the building blocks are actually built, all that's left is to utilize them to populate the game environment with functional UI elements. I focused a lot on making these systems expandable (minus the actual user interface layout, which is mostly hardcoded because of time constraints), and so the majority of the work is in the back-end of the project.

In any case, I was capable of making something that, at the minimum, expressed the ideas that I wanted to explore, and I'm happy about that.
