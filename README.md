# S.O.S.

_S.O.S._ is a (WIP) game. [Play it here] (https://vi-victor.github.io/S.O.S./)

(requires a browser with PointerLock API support, like Chrome)

It stands for "Sounds Of Space", and is meant to convey feelings of loneliness, isolation, and a desire to explore. Currently, it consists of a space-like environment with a few UI elements tied to a somewhat randomly arranged set of 4 synthesizers, each with their own sequence.

In the future, I hope to expand it to an explorable space-like environment where sequences are tied to various celestial bodies, and the player must explore to find different modules which modify how the sequences from the celestial bodies are synthesized.

At the moment, the sound synthesis and sequencing systems are complete, as well as a few of the UI elements. The next step would be to introduce a sequence generation system and a procedurally generated universe with generated sequences tied to the stars.

### libraries / frameworks / other people's code
-Three.js

-PointerLockControls.js for camera controls, from the Three.js examples.

-Tone.js for audio synthesis and interactive audio manipulation.
